# Sentimental_Analysis_Deeplearning
Our study examines how deep learning models like LSTM, GRU, CNN, and hybrid models (LSTM+CNN, LSTM+GRU, GRU+CNN) capture complex sentiment patterns in text data. â€¢Additionally, we study integrating BOW and TF-IDF as complementing features to improve model predictive power.
